# Original Number Theory Problems

This repository contains a short collection of **original number–theoretic problems** written and solved by Jack Westbrook.  
The problems explore Diophantine equations, modular arithmetic, and elementary aspects of algebraic number theory.

## Overview

The collection currently includes 9 problems, each with a complete solution.  
Topics include:
- Non-existence of integral points on certain Diophantine equations and elliptic curves  
- Modular obstructions and quadratic reciprocity arguments  
- Examples of irreducibility over number fields and finite fields  
- Constructions inspired by class field–theoretic methods  

One of these problems was featured at the **UW–Madison Putnam Club**,  
where students attempted the problem during a meeting and I presented the solution.

## Highlights

- **Problem 2:** Uses factorization in ℤ\[i\] to show there are no integral points on *y² = x³ − 9*.  
- **Problem 3:** Demonstrates how modular arguments rule out integral points on *y² = x³ − 62*.  
- **Problem 8:** Applies factorization in ℤ\[ω\] (ω = (1 + √−11)/2) to determine all integral points on *y² = x³ − 11*.  
- **Problem 9:** Shows the irreducibility of *f(X)=X⁶−108* over ℚ via reduction mod 7.

## Future plans

I plan to:
- Add more problems as I come up with them.
